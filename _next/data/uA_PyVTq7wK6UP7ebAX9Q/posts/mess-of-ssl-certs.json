{"pageProps":{"title":"File formats and terms used in the context of SSL","content":"<h2 id=\"preface\">Preface</h2>\n<p>You may have heard many buzzwords when reading SSL cert related articles, like <code>.pem</code>, <code>cer</code>, <code>der</code>, <code>jks</code>, <code>pkcs12</code>, etc.  One could easily get confused by these terms as there are dozen of them.\nThis article aims to sort out some of the frequently heard file format and terms and try to explain why and how they are used.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ssl-objects\">SSL Objects</h2>\n<p>When talking SSL, we are talking about a context where the information in it can be exchanged with trust.  And such safety and trust is established upon SSL certs and certificate authorities who recognize them.  <br>However we are here today not to discuss how SSL actually works because that would bring up another discussion that can span a whole day long. <br>You just need to know that in order to generate certificates used in SSL contexts, a series of SSL objects are needed.  And we need different <code>container format</code> to store these SSL objects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-container-formats-and-their-extension\">The container formats and their extension</h2>\n<p>A container in the following context refers to the file that is used to store data in a way that machine can understand it.  See below table for the most widely used container formats.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Extension</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Format</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Definition</th>\n<th>Convertible</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>.der</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Binary</td>\n<td align=\"left\">A way to encode <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASN.1\">ASN.1</a> syntax in binary</td>\n<td>to .pem</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>.pem</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Plaintext</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Plain text representation of <code>.der</code>.

Its content is the same as .keystore / .jks</td>\n<td>same as as above</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h2 id=\"the-ssl-objects-and-their-extension\">The SSL objects and their extension</h2>\n<p>The SSL objects can be encoded into different container format like <code>.der</code> or <code>.pem</code>.  See below table.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Extension</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Definition</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Container format</th>\n<th>Use case</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>.csr .p10</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Cert signing request.
